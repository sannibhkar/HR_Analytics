# HR_Analytics
For this project I have gathered some data, processed it further, removed duplicates and null values and created a dashboard on Power Bi. I have used many types of charts, matrix and slicer forms for visualizations.
The CSV file for the data had to be added to power bi and had to remove the duplicate files. Then there were certain null values as well which had to be removed.
A seperate column - AttritionCount had to be created for further analysis.
AttritionRate calculation had to be craeted using PowerQuery through the new measure tool and not creating a seperate column for it.
Hope you found this helpful.
