# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

This project is about creating a power bi dashboard for HR analytics. The dashboard aims to analyze the attrition of employees and identify the reasons why people of different age groups and domains are leaving the company. The dashboard also provides insights into the employee satisfaction, performance, and retention.

## Data Source

The data source for this project is a CSV file that contains information about the employees, such as their age, gender, department, education, job role, salary, job satisfaction, performance rating, attrition, etc.

## Data Preparation

The data preparation process involves the following steps:

- Importing the CSV file into power bi
- Cleaning the data by removing duplicates, missing values, and outliers
- Creating calculated columns and measures to derive new variables, such as attrition rate, average salary, turnover cost, etc.
- Applying filters and slicers to select the relevant data for analysis
- Creating relationships between the tables based on the common fields

## Data Visualization

The data visualization process involves the following steps:

- Choosing the appropriate types of charts and graphs to display the data
- Applying colors, labels, titles, and legends to enhance the readability and aesthetics of the charts and graphs
- Arranging the charts and graphs into a logical and coherent layout
- Adding interactivity and drill-down features to enable the users to explore the data in depth

The dashboard consists of four pages:

- Overview: This page provides a summary of the key metrics and trends related to the attrition of employees, such as the total number of employees, the attrition rate, the average salary, the turnover cost, etc. It also shows the distribution of employees by age, gender, department, and job role.
- Satisfaction: This page analyzes the relationship between the employee satisfaction and the attrition. It shows the satisfaction level of the employees who stayed and left the company, as well as the factors that influence the satisfaction, such as the salary, the performance rating, the work environment, etc.
- Performance: This page evaluates the impact of the employee performance on the attrition. It shows the performance rating of the employees who stayed and left the company, as well as the factors that affect the performance, such as the education, the training, the feedback, etc.
- Retention: This page identifies the best practices and strategies to retain the employees and reduce the attrition. It shows the retention rate of the employees by different criteria, such as the age group, the domain, the job role, etc. It also suggests some recommendations and actions to improve the retention, such as the career development, the recognition, the incentives, etc.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of power bi to create a dashboard for HR analytics. The dashboard provides valuable insights into the attrition of employees and the reasons behind it. The dashboard also helps the HR managers to make informed decisions and implement effective policies to enhance the employee satisfaction, performance, and retention.
